# Additional ideas (Barcamp)
* Use of deep learning algorithm to classify names, addresses, etc.
* Preview of source file content after loading
* In graph view: show first entry on each node
* Save and load operations for the graph
* First convert source file to new structure, before loading into master sheet.
* If you import a file a second time, write/rewrite only rows with modifications
* Store source sheet id into a row of the master sheet
* Create a backup on google drive or outside.
