### (codename "ddrj": drive-driven journalism) 

Making Google Sheets Journalism-compatible (in other words turn them into something like super-simple database with one table), i.e. unify spreadsheet structures to save many headaches... 

   * Merge source sheets into one master sheet
   * Enforce column types & semantic consistency
   * Maintain uniqueness & reproducibility (IDs, timestamps)
   * (Automagic offsite backup routine)
  
All of this will be deployed as Google "Web App", an addon to Google Sheets. 

### Why Google Drive?

Because we all love Google? No. But we think that currently, there's no better alternative for collaborative spreadsheet editing.
